                "I find it more useful as a reference to accompany a Udemy class I paid ten bucks for. " +
                "Wish it was a little less wordy so it would be easier to digest.", LocalDate.now());

                "This is by far worth every penny. Simple to understand, useful code examples, and fair use of the enormous Java library reachable through a simple import. " +
                "Bruce's examples are clear and he makes intermediate topics easy to grasp. 6 stars.", LocalDate.now());
        Comment comment3 = new Comment("Calling this \"the hard way\" could not be a bigger understatement. I used to think I was a smart person until I got this book." +
                " I can not for the life of me understand why he does certain things, and it is extremely difficult to find answers. I do not recommend this book for beginners because you will want to slam your head into a wall. " +
                "After 4 days and 15+ hours, it is time for me to burn this book and try to find a different resource.", LocalDate.now());
        Comment comment4 = new Comment("As a newbe not only to Python but OOP in general this is by far the best book I have for actually learning the subject through actual programming and not just reading about it. " +
                "It gently eases you in for the first 2 3rds but at the point of learning classes it seems to take off a bit so I've had to slow down at that point.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "If you follow it as it intends it's not a quick book to zoom through but you will learn how to program in Python which is the entire point of the book. " +
                "Take your time with it, there are no short cuts to learning this stuff but this book teaches it well.", LocalDate.now());
        Comment comment5 = new Comment("The book is decent but depends on the videos found online. There are no supplemental PDF's for use offline to troubleshoot the lessons. " +
                "This book is completely dependent on having a fast Internet connection and being online the whole time for video.", LocalDate.now());
